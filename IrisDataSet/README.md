Building a logistic regression model to predict the class of flower based on the available attributes.

In the dataset, we're looking at the class of the iris plant - Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica.

The first four columns in the Iris.csv file consists of the following information:
1. septal length (in cm)
2. septal width (in cm)
3. petal length (in cm)
4. petal width (in cm)



We use the logistic model to model the probability of a certain class existing in one of the classes we're looking at.
